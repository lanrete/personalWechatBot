# Personal Wechat Bot

This is a very personal wechat bot with very limited functionality in design.  The bot is designed to receive and store images/url/media files
for weekly summarizing purpose.

I'm building this small bot for my S.O so that her work can be a little easier.

I'm also building this tool as my learning process toward JavaScript and maybe transfer to TypeScript if needed.

# Status

The robot is still in very early stage. I am exploring the `Wechaty` module at the moment to understand the functionality and API calls, as well
as understanding the syntax and feature of JavaScript.

# Functionality

The main functionality of this robot is to save image/sharing through links with user-defined topics so that these materials can be used in the weekly/monthly summarization.

Current idea is to use the user-to-user chat as of a way to receive information. Might switch to group-based version if suited.
